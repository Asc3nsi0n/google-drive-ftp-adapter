If you want to sync your files,\r\n  you should do it with your FTP tool.\r\n- Google drive supports repeated filenames in same folder and illegal file names in contrast to many operating systems. \r\n  But don't worry because this is supported! These files will appear with chars encoded to _ (underscore) and an ID\r\n  to keep track of the file. \r\n\r\nSource Code\r\n===========\r\n\r\n[GitHub](https://github.com/andresoviedo/google-drive-ftp-adapter)\r\n\r\nWeb Site\r\n========\r\n\r\n(http://google-drive-ftp-adapter.andresoviedo.org)\r\n\r\nDownloads\r\n=========\r\n\r\nLatest Release 1.2.3 - 07 April 2016\r\n- Option 1 - /ยก\\ Java Required          : [jar-with-dependencies.jar](build/google-drive-ftp-adapter-jar-with-dependencies.jar)\r\n- Option 2 - /ยก\\ Java Required          : [adapter-bundle.zip](build/google-drive-ftp-adapter-bundle.zip)\r\n- Option 3 - Java for Windows included  : [adapter-bundle-jre7-win32.zip](build/google-drive-ftp-adapter-win32-jre7-bundle.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\nBuid It!\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe project is packaged with Maven. If you want to build it just download the project, compile it and run Java with \"org.andresoviedo.apps.gdrive_ftp_adapter.Main\"\r\n\r\nRun it!\r\n======\r\n\r\n- If you have Java installed already all you have to do is download jar-with-dependencies.jar and double click on it or run from command line:\r\n\r\n    $ java -jar google-drive-ftp-adapter-jar-with-dependencies.jar\r\n    \r\n- If you don't have Java installed and you are in Windows:\r\n  - Download from [here](build/google-drive-ftp-adapter-win32-jre7-bundle.zip)\r\n  - Unzip it\r\n  - Execute windows-install-java.cmd\r\n  - Execute start.cmd\r\n- Once the application is started, Google with request authorization through your browser to allow Google Drive FTP access to your data. Click \"OK\". \r\n\t\r\nTest it!\r\n========\r\n\r\n- Open ftp://user:user@localhost:1821/ in your browser to connect to your Google Drive.\r\n\r\n- Or open terminal and type \"ftp localhost 1821\": Type \"user\" as the username and \"user\" as password. Once in FTP, type \"dir\" to see your drive files.\r\n\r\nFtp example:\r\n\r\n    $ ftp localhost 1821\r\n    Connected to localhost.\r\n    220 Service ready for new user.\r\n    Name (localhost:andres): user\r\n    331 User name okay, need password for user.\r\n    Password:\r\n    230 User logged in, proceed.\r\n    Remote system type is UNIX.\r\n    $ ftp> dir\r\n    200 Command PORT okay.\r\n    150 File status okay; about to open data connection.\r\n    drwx------   0 uknown no_group            0 Nov 16  2013 SOFTWARE\r\n    drwx------   0 uknown no_group            0 Oct 29  2013 NEXUS7\r\n    drwx------   0 uknown no_group            0 Oct 19  2013 MUSIC\r\n    -rw-------   0 uknown no_group      5348582 Apr 30 22:15 Dr. Toast - Light.mp3\r\n    -rw-------   0 uknown no_group      1936326 Dec 21  2014 avatar2.jpg\r\n    226 Closing data connection\r\n    $ ftp>\r\n\r\nApplication Configuration\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThe application works fine without configuration. However, a default 'configuration.properties' file is provided\r\nin case you want to customize them.\r\n\r\nIf you want, you can also customize the path of the 'configuration.properties' when launching the app:\r\n\r\n    $ java -jar google-drive-ftp-adapter.jar [propertiesFilename] \r\n    \r\nHere are the application parameters you can customize:\r\n\r\n    # log4j.fileId if you have more than 1 instance of the app running\r\n    log4j.fileId=\r\n    \r\n    # account name associated to cache and Google credentials \r\n    account=default\r\n    \r\n    # FTP port listening for incoming connections\r\n    port=1821\r\n    \r\n    # FTP Enable anonymous login?\r\n    ftp.anonymous.enabled=false\r\n    \r\n    # FTP default user credentials\r\n    ftp.user=user\r\n    ftp.pass=user\r\n    \r\n    # Illegal characters for your file system so file copying works fine  \r\n    os.illegalCharacters=\\\\/|[\\\\x00-\\\\x1F\\\\x7F]|\\\\`|\\\\?|\\\\*|\\\\\\\\|\\\\<|\\\\>|\\\\||\\\\\"|\\\\:\r\n\r\n**account**\r\n\r\nThis is the name associated to the cache and Google credentials, so the next time you run the application you don't\r\nhave to re-login or resynchronize all of the application cache. This is also the name of the subfolder under \"/data\"\r\nwhere information is going to be stored. Default value is \"default\".\r\n\r\n**port**\r\n\r\nTCP port number where the ftp adapter is going to listen for ftp clients. Default FTP port is 21, but In Linux \r\nthis is a reserved port and ports below 1024 are privileged, so we use port 1821. Default is 1821.\r\nThere is another start2.cmd as example (Windows) that start an FTP adapter at port 22. \r\n\r\n- Note: If you have different Google Drive accounts, you can launch multiple google-drive-ftp-adapter \r\n  in the same machine, each listening at a different port. Just put a different fileId so they write logs in different files.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.A.Q.\r\n======\r\n\r\n - Question: When I type in the username and password on the FTP client (e.g. in the FileZilla) it tells me \"Authentication Failed\":\r\n   - Answer: The user credentials to login to the ftp server are not the same user credentials that you use for loging into your google account.\r\n     Check in the README.md for the default user credentials to use.\r\n  \r\n - Question: In my ftp client (e.g. FileZilla), when I download my google documents and I click on it they don't open.\r\n   - Answer: If they are documents like word or excel (either if it's google filetype or not), your filenames should end with a proper\r\n     filename extesion like \"my_document.doc\" or \"my_google_sheet.xls\" so your operating system can open it with your deafult installed applications.\r\n \r\n - Question: How can I start a secondary server?\r\n   - Answer: You have 2 options so far:\r\n   \t * in the start2.cmd you have an example how to launch a secondary server passing an accountId and secondary port number. \r\n   \t   You may have different start.cmd to start different ftp servers (i.e. start-foo.cmd, start-bar.cmd).\r\n     * Or instead of passing the accounId and port number, you can pass a /path/to/secondary.properties \r\n       That way you can specify different account ids and ports inside the file. \r\n\r\n - Question: When I launch the application nothing happens.\r\n   - Answer:  Check that in the console or file log there is no errors. Check that your default Internet browser doesn't have any plugin\r\n     that is causing the google authentication dialog to have any problems.  \r\n \r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n============\r\n\r\n- If you are in Windows 10 and you an error like the following, try to run program or terminal as administrator: \r\n  java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\\Users\\Zeo\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\sqlite-3.7.151-x86-sqlitejdbc.dll: Access is denied\r\n  \r\n- For some type of files, the size of files reported by Google differs from what the local operating system does (for example: .txt and .3gp) (Fix TBA)\r\n- If you have timeout problems because of slow internet connectivity, try incrementing the timeout in your FTP client.\r\n  \r\nDisclaimer\r\n==========\r\n\t\r\n- This application is released under the LGPL license. Use this application at your own risk.\r\n- This application uses a Google Drive API Key with a courtesy of 10 requests/second/user and 10 million\r\n  request/day. When it reaches the quota the application may stop working.\r\n  \r\nProject Info\r\n============ \r\n\r\nThis application lets you connect your FTP applications to your Google Drive files through the FTP protocol \r\nrather than using the official Google Drive client.\r\n\r\nThis custom Google Drive client was created because the official client can't be reinstalled on a new PC without \r\nhaving to download all your drive files again. Also, because the official client does not support FAT32\r\npartitions and I used to have all my files in one of this partitions.\r\n\r\nSo this application basically starts a FTP server in your local machine emulating that it is hosting your \r\nGoogle Drive files, acting as a gateway. Once this setup is done, you can connect any FTP client to connect \r\nto your Google Drive files. I use it in conjunction with Beyond Compare to compare my local files \r\n(stored anywhere in my cloud ;) and compare them to ones I have in the Google Drive cloud.\r\n\r\nYou are free to use this program while you keep this file and the authoring comments in the code. Any comments \r\nand suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n===================\r\n\r\n[Contact](http://www.andresoviedo.org)\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n==========\r\n\r\n(f) fixed, (i) improved, (n) new feature\r\n\r\n- v1.2.3 (07/04/2016)\r\n - (f) Controlling of google drive service user rate limit.
